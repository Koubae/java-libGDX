## ✅ Best Practices When Using OpenGameArt

1. **Check the license for each asset**  
   Always verify that the license allows **commercial use** and note any obligations  
   (e.g., attribution or share-alike).

2. **Record attribution details**  
   Save the following for every asset you use:  
   - Name of the asset  
   - Author/creator  
   - License type  
   - Link to the original source  
   This makes it easier to include proper credits in your game.

3. **Prefer safe licenses**  
   Use assets under **CC0**, **OGA-BY**, or **CC-BY** (with attribution)  
   for the simplest usage in both commercial and closed-source projects.

4. **Be cautious with GPL / CC-BY-SA**  
   - **ShareAlike (SA)**: requires derivatives to use the same license.  
   - **GPL**: often conflicts with closed-source or proprietary games.  
   Use only if you fully understand the implications.

5. **Bundle license info with your game**  
   Include a file or folder in your game distribution listing:  
   - All used assets  
   - Their licenses  
   - Full license texts (if required)  
   This keeps everything transparent and legally safe.


## ⚠️ Caveats & What to Watch Out For

- **License matters per asset**  
  Just because the site is “free assets” doesn’t mean every piece is CC0.  
  Each upload has its own license.

- **CC-BY / CC-BY-SA / OGA-BY require attribution**  
  - **CC-BY**: You must credit the original creator.  
  - **CC-BY-SA**: In addition to attribution, derivatives must carry the same license.  
  - **OGA-BY**: Similar to CC-BY but removes certain technical restrictions.

- **GPL-licensed assets are tricky**  
  GPL is designed for software, not art.  
  Using GPL assets in a non-GPL (closed-source) game can create licensing conflicts.

- **Technical restriction clauses**  
  Some licenses (like CC-BY) include clauses against DRM or technical limitations.  
  OGA-BY was created to avoid these issues.

- **Safe choices for commercial games**  
  Stick with **CC0**, **OGA-BY**, or **CC-BY** (with proper attribution)  
  to avoid complications.
